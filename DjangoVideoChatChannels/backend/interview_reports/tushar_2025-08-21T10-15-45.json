                "feedback": "The answer is extremely unclear, lacking specific examples and details.  It doesn't demonstrate a sufficient understanding of React Hooks or their application.  The candidate needs to practice articulating technical concepts clearly and concisely, providing concrete examples from their work."

                "feedback": "The candidate's response is completely inadequate.  It shows a lack of preparation and understanding of the technical concepts involved.  The question needs to be re-addressed to assess their skills.  Consider asking simpler questions to gauge their basic knowledge of React Hooks before moving on to more complex scenarios."

            "answer": "Uh, significant challenge. I encountered was managing a synchronous data flow and state synchronization between the react front end, and plus back end specially when handling credit operations that require UI immediately reflect changes.",

The candidate identifies a relevant challenge (synchronous data flow and state synchronization in financial transactions), but fails to describe the specific problem, the solution implemented, or the technologies used in sufficient detail.  The response needs significant improvement in clarity and completeness to demonstrate technical competency."
