            "question": "Considering your experience building AI-powered applications using FastAPI and other frameworks, can you describe your approach to designing and implementing a RESTful API for a new feature in a larger system, and how you would ensure its scalability and maintainability?",
            "answer": "So, basically, I use, I I develop a power system with using the flask not the first API. That's it. All about this.",

                "feedback": "The response is extremely brief, unclear, and irrelevant to the question.  It mentions Flask, not FastAPI as requested, and lacks any details on design, implementation, scalability, or maintainability.  The candidate needs to significantly improve their ability to articulate their technical experience and problem-solving approach."

            "question": "Can you please elaborate on your experience building RESTful APIs, including specific examples of how you've addressed scalability and maintainability challenges in previous projects, and clarify why you chose Flask over FastAPI in those instances?",
            "answer": "So, because of flask is very lightweight and it's very use for the development of the food application. That's why I use flask instead of the first API first API is used in the production level apis things. So, for as of now, I don't need any kind of production related things, that's why",

                "feedback": "The answer lacks clarity, detail, and specifics.  It fails to address scalability and maintainability, provide concrete examples, or give a compelling reason for choosing Flask over FastAPI.  Significant improvement is needed in both technical explanation and communication."
