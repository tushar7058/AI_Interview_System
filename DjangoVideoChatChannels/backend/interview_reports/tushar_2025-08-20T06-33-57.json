The candidate needs to review fundamental concepts of these frameworks and practice articulating technical challenges and solutions effectively."

The candidate needs to provide a concrete example of an AI-powered application they built, specifying the technologies used (including clarifying the actual frameworks employed instead of the mistakenly mentioned FastAPI and Django if those were not used).  A detailed description of their role and contributions is crucial."
