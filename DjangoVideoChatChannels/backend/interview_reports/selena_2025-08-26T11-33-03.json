                "feedback": "The answer lacks clarity, detail, and specific examples.  It's difficult to understand the candidate's experience with React Hooks.  The response needs substantial improvement;  mention specific projects and concrete examples of how you used useState, useEffect, and other hooks to solve problems.  Avoid vague terms like 'a bag for giving effects'."

                "feedback": "The answer is incomprehensible and fails to address the question.  It lacks any specific example, code, or explanation of a problem solved. The candidate needs to drastically improve their communication skills and provide concrete examples to demonstrate their technical abilities."

The candidate needs to be upfront about their experience (or lack thereof) and avoid misrepresenting their skills.  This answer raises serious concerns about their suitability for the role."

                "feedback": "The answer is clear in stating what was done, but lacks depth and honesty.  The candidate needs to clarify what their contributions actually were.  Copying a system and integrating it with a large language model (presumably ChatGPT) does not constitute 'building' a system.  This response raises serious concerns about the candidate's integrity and understanding of software engineering practices.  More detailed explanation of their role and contributions is crucial."

To be considered, please provide specific examples of React projects and explain your approach to reusable component creation, including technologies and patterns used (e.g., functional components, hooks, state management solutions)."

                "feedback": "The answer is clear and concise, but lacks substance.  It's honest, but to be a competitive candidate, describe any exposure to React, even if it's just tutorials or very small projects.  Mentioning specific components, hooks, or concepts you've worked with would significantly improve your response."

It doesn't describe specific challenges encountered during integration (e.g., data format issues, API design choices, authentication methods, error handling).
