The description of the technical challenge and the solution is too vague and lacks specifics.

It fails to describe a specific challenge or demonstrate understanding of React concepts like state management and component lifecycle.  The response is too vague and doesn't address the question.

So, there is no need of the data persistent. So, it is just like UI based content project, so it will render on the screen. And it will, uh, it can be also removed from the screen also. So there is no data persistent. And yes, I use the State Management hook which is used state to maintain, uh, the, the modification. And, and the changes made in the note.",
