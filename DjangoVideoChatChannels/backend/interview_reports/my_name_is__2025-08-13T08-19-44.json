            "question": "Your work on the AI-powered interview system using FastAPI and OpenAI APIs sounds very interesting. When developing the backend for such an application, how did you approach designing the APIs and backend logic to ensure scalability and maintainability?",
            "answer": "Django as well. So I don't have that that much I had about.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "This answer is highly problematic. It fails to address any part of the question regarding API design, scalability, or maintainability for the FastAPI/OpenAI system mentioned. Bringing up 'Django' is off-topic, and the latter part of the response is incoherent, suggesting a complete lack of understanding or ability to articulate any relevant experience. This answer raises significant concerns about the candidate's actual involvement in or understanding of the project described."

        },
        {
            "question": "Could you clarify which framework was used for the AI interview system, and how you approached scalability and maintainability there?",

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The answer 'but,' is incomplete and does not provide a coherent or relevant response to the statement 'There was an error communicating with the language model.' It's unclear what you intended to convey. In a professional setting, especially when faced with an unexpected technical message, a more complete response that clarifies understanding, offers a solution, or asks for more information would be expected. This answer provides no insight into your problem-solving, communication, or critical thinking abilities."

            "question": "Your 'Hotel Reservation System' project involved deploying scalable models using CI/CD and GCP. What was a specific challenge you addressed related to the deployment or ongoing maintenance of that backend system?",
            "answer": "So I don't have any kind of idea about the hotel reservation system, but I have the knowledge about the Chinese in gcp and cicd pipeline as well.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 2,
                "feedback": "Your answer directly states a lack of experience with the 'Hotel Reservation System' project mentioned in the question. While honesty is appreciated, the prompt was an opportunity to discuss a specific technical challenge related to deployment or maintenance using CI/CD and GCP. A more effective approach would be to pivot and describe a challenge from a *different* project where you utilized these technologies, demonstrating your relevant skills. Simply stating general knowledge about CI/CD and GCP without a concrete example or challenge does not answer the question's core. Also, 'Chinese' appears to be a typo or misunderstanding; please ensure clarity in your technical terms."

            "question": "Could you clarify what you mean by 'Chinese in GCP'?",

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 4,
                "feedback": "You correctly identified the need to clarify your previous statement, which is a good instinct. However, your response contains significant grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., 'I'm not mean that', 'I have work on', 'the some gcp workflows'). This makes your clarification difficult to understand and reflects poorly on your communication skills, which are crucial in a professional setting. Focus on clear, concise, and grammatically correct English to ensure your message is accurately received."

            "question": "Your projects involved backend systems using databases. Can you describe a specific instance where you designed a database schema or optimized a database query for a feature, and what factors you considered in that process?",
            "answer": "So basically, I worked on several uh, back end systems including database system as well. I have the knowledge about the flask jungle and the first API. So I have the knowledge about the my MySQL as well. But I work on several project in a school.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 2,
                "feedback": "The answer is very general and does not address the core of the question. You stated you worked on backend systems and have knowledge of Flask, Django, FastAPI, and MySQL, which are relevant technologies. However, the prompt specifically asked for a *specific instance* where you designed a database schema or optimized a query, and *what factors you considered*. Your response lacks any concrete example, details about a particular project, or the decision-making process involved. To improve, structure your answer using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to describe a specific database-related challenge you faced, how you approached it (e.g., schema design principles, normalization, indexing for query optimization), and the outcome."

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "This answer is too brief and does not address the core of the question. You mentioned 'Amazon' but the question specifically asked about *school projects* and for a *specific instance* where you designed a schema or optimized a query. Your answer provides no detail about your involvement, the project, the design, or the optimization process. To improve, you need to provide a concrete example from a school project, detailing what you did, how you did it, and the outcome, perhaps using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)."

            "question": "In your Gesture & Voice-Controlled AI Virtual Mouse project, you mentioned achieving 50ms latency using multi-threading. Could you describe your approach to implementing multi-threading in Python for real-time performance?",
            "answer": "Okay.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "This response does not provide any information or answer the question. As an interviewer, I would be looking for a detailed explanation of your multi-threading implementation, including specific Python modules, how you addressed the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), and any other techniques used to achieve low latency. Your answer should demonstrate your technical understanding and project involvement."

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 2.0,
                "feedback": "The answer is very high-level and lacks technical depth regarding your multi-threading approach. While you mention a relevant use case (concurrent speech processing), you don't elaborate on *how* you implemented it, what specific tasks ran in separate threads, how they communicated, what challenges you faced, or any specific technologies/patterns used. The core of the question, 'your approach,' remains unanswered. Additionally, the communication was hesitant and ended with a question, which doesn't convey confidence or a clear understanding of the solution you built. To improve, focus on providing concrete technical details, design choices, and the specific problems multi-threading solved for your project."
