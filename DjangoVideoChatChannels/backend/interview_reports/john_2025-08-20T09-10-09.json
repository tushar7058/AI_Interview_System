The response is vague and uses filler words.  Focus on a specific challenge, clearly articulate the problem, and then detail your solution, highlighting the relevant React concepts and how you applied them."

The candidate needs to significantly improve their communication skills and ability to articulate technical challenges and solutions.  A complete rewrite is necessary, focusing on specific challenges and the rationale behind choosing (or rejecting) particular state management solutions."

It mentions a hook but provides no context, details, or explanation of how it relates to React lifecycle methods or performance/UX improvements in the Keeper app.  A complete rewrite is needed focusing on a specific scenario and demonstrating understanding of component lifecycle methods."
