            "answer": "So, API is used for specifically application process process interface. It is. The best on middleware between the front end and the back end. It connects the back end to the front end. It's very important in any, uh, full check application.",

The cloud Department, typically, in order for the following step containerization and Docker containerization and dog file, created root python project this file Define the environment and structure for the docker image.",

Verify the slowness by heating the end. End point myself with similar parameters, gather initial data. Check if a response time in monitoring tools, uh third inspect, the API code view the end point code for a base issue. Looks for any patient alone optimized database or lack patiens. That's it.",
