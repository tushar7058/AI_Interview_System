They did not describe any situation, steps taken, or demonstrate any understanding of performance optimization in the context of FastAPI. (Score: 1.0/10)

Q: Based on your resume, youâ€™ve worked with both Flask and Django. Can you explain a key difference between them and when you might choose one over the other for a new project?
A: The candidates respond based on your resume, you've worked with both flask and Django. Can you explain the key difference between them? And when you might choose 1 over the other for a new project. So I don't have that much knowledge about this project but I have no knowledge about the Django and the flask.

So we we fully application is very important for us to the building the end to end project in various Technologies like the Django flask and it Etc. So I have knowledge about the Django and the flask
Feedback: The candidate's response is very weak. They initially admit to a lack of knowledge about Django and Flask, contradicting the implication from their resume that they have experience with them. The subsequent attempt to describe their use is vague, nonsensical, and doesn't answer the question about key differences or when to choose one over the other. The answer indicates a significant gap in understanding of these frameworks. Further probing is necessary to determine the candidate's actual skill level. (Score: 2.0/10)
