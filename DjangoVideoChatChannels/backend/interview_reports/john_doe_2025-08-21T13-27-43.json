                "score": 3.5,
                "feedback": "The answer is clear and honestly communicated, but completely lacks relevance to the question.  It indicates a significant skills gap for this role requiring React Hooks expertise. Consider focusing your job search on roles leveraging your Python skills."

                "score": 1.8,
                "feedback": "The response is extremely vague and lacks any description of a challenging situation or its solution.  It fails to address the question's requirements.  The candidate needs to significantly improve their communication skills and provide concrete examples to demonstrate their technical abilities."

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 2.8,
                "feedback": "The response is extremely vague and lacks detail.  It doesn't describe a specific challenge, nor does it explain the solution in any meaningful way. Using ChatGPT as a solution without explaining the problem or the specific steps taken is insufficient.  The answer needs significant improvement in clarity, structure, and technical depth to demonstrate relevant experience."

                "feedback": "The candidate's response directly admits a lack of relevant experience. While the communication is clear, the answer is completely irrelevant and lacks depth and completeness regarding the question.  Focus on transferable skills or projects that demonstrate relevant abilities if you lack direct experience in React for facial recognition systems. Consider alternative projects, or be prepared to explain honestly why your experience is limited in this area."
