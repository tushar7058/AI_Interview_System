                "feedback": "The response is completely irrelevant and lacks any information about React Hooks or the Keeper App.  It indicates a significant gap in the required skills.  The candidate needs to honestly assess their skills and provide accurate information about their experience."

            "answer": "So, I use that for the content development because I have the knowledge basic knowledge about the react. So, react is basically used for the building components in the front end applications.",

The candidate should review relevant concepts and prepare a more detailed, concrete example.  Focus on describing the problem, chosen approach (even if not fully successful), and the outcome.  Avoid vague phrases like 'I attempted differently'."

It lacks any explanation of a specific situation, the chosen state management solution, or how data integrity was maintained.

Your previous response was unclear.",
            "answer": "So uh prop sources, State prompts inputs from parent, State components, owns data with change Setter, then they need to remember something that can change from the inputs and a free data. So keep state in the closest and common parent.",

It mentions key concepts (props, state, setters) but fails to explain how they were applied in the Keeper App.  The phrasing is disorganized and unprofessional.  A complete rewrite is needed, focusing on concrete examples from the project to illustrate your approach to state management and data integrity."

            "answer": "Component is born lives and then lives, react gives a special function called life cycle matter, to run code during this stage. In models react function, we mostly use hooks.",
