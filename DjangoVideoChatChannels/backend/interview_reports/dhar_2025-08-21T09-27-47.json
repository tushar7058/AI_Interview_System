The candidate needs to significantly improve their ability to articulate technical details and provide concrete examples from their experience."

It doesn't address the question about component state and props in the Keeper app. The candidate should review fundamental React concepts and practice articulating technical details in a structured manner.  Prepare concrete examples to showcase your skills."

So while the developing my application, I faced a lot of problems while the integration related like the Apex thing, will I see your face the a lot of problems?",

The candidate needs to articulate a specific technical challenge, their approach to solving it, and how React concepts were utilized.  The response is also grammatically flawed and difficult to understand."

Consider focusing on a past project (even if outside of React) where you managed complex data or interactions, and detailing the challenges, your approach, and the outcome.  This would demonstrate transferable skills."

The candidate needs to review fundamental React concepts, especially components and state management before applying again. The statement about not knowing React routes is only partially relevant at best; the question focuses on component state."
