            "question": "Your experience includes building AI-powered systems using FastAPI and Django. Could you share how you approached designing these APIs to ensure they were efficient and scalable?",
            "answer": "So, I don't know about this, uh, but",

                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate provided no relevant information to answer the question. This response indicates a complete lack of experience or understanding of the subject matter, or an inability to articulate any related experience."
            }
        },
        {
            "question": "You mentioned 'but' at the end; were you about to clarify something regarding your experience?",
            "answer": "So I don't have the that much experience in that.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 4,
                "feedback": "The candidate directly answers the question, which is good. However, the phrasing 'the that much experience' is grammatically awkward and unpolished, detracting from professionalism. This was also a missed opportunity to elaborate, for example, by discussing transferable skills, a willingness to learn, or how they are actively gaining experience in that area. The answer comes across as blunt and lacks the polish expected in a professional interview setting."
            }
        },
        {
            "question": "Considering your experience building APIs that interact with databases, what steps do you take to ensure data integrity and optimize query performance for backend efficiency?",
            "answer": "I don't have, I don't have answer.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate explicitly states they do not have an answer. This response is a complete failure to address the question and indicates either a lack of fundamental experience in the required domain or an unwillingness/inability to articulate it. For a role requiring API and database interaction, this is an immediate disqualifier and shows a significant lack of preparation."
            }
        },
        {
            "question": "Can you tell me about your overall experience working with databases or building APIs?",
            "answer": "So I have a 3X of experience in the working databases uh with the scale because I scale is a very important language to work with database, as well. As I have experience with the EPS related things, I have built some apis with the using of Django flask and uh uh, Etc. So that's it.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 3,
                "feedback": "The answer attempts to address both parts of the question, mentioning databases and APIs. However, there are significant issues with clarity, precision, and articulation. Phrases like '3X of experience' are unclear, and stating 'scale' is a 'very important language' for databases is technically incorrect (perhaps you meant SQL or scalability). 'EPS' appears to be a mispronunciation of 'APIs'. While mentioning Django and Flask for API building is good, the 'Etc.' is vague. To improve, focus on clear communication, accurate terminology, and providing more specific examples of projects or responsibilities rather than vague generalities."
            }
        },
        {
            "question": "This role involves collaborating with frontend developers to integrate user-facing elements. Can you describe your approach to ensuring smooth communication and integration between your backend APIs and the frontend?",
            "answer": "So I don't have any kind of add about this.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The answer is completely unclear and does not address the question at all. This response suggests a significant lack of understanding of a core job responsibility or a complete absence of relevant experience. For future interviews, it's crucial to either ask for clarification if unsure about the question or articulate any relevant experience/knowledge, no matter how limited, to demonstrate your potential."
            }
        },
        {
            "question": "Could you clarify what you mean by 'add about this' in the context of backend-frontend integration?",
            "answer": "so I don't know about the front end things, but I have the knowledge about the back end because I have the knowledge about the jungle and the flask",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 3,
                "feedback": "The candidate failed to address the core of the question, which was a request for clarification. Instead of seeking more information about 'add about this' or offering to clarify the integration process from their backend perspective, they sidestepped by stating their limited knowledge about frontend and then listed backend technologies. A stronger answer would involve asking clarifying follow-up questions, explaining common backend-frontend integration points (e.g., APIs, data contracts) and how 'add about this' might fit in, or admitting they don't understand the phrase and asking for an example. Additionally, misspelling a common framework like 'Django' (likely 'jungle') is a minor concern."

        {
            "question": "You've worked with Docker and deployed applications to GCP. Can you describe your process for containerizing a Python backend service and deploying it to a cloud environment, considering how you'd manage its dependencies and ensure it's ready for production?",
            "answer": "Okay, okay.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The answer 'Okay, okay.' provides no substance or detail regarding the process for containerizing and deploying a Python backend service. It indicates a complete lack of response to the technical question asked, and does not demonstrate any knowledge of Docker, GCP, dependency management, or production readiness. This answer is entirely insufficient and would require the candidate to be prompted for a full explanation."
            }
        },
        {
            "question": "Please describe your process for containerizing and deploying the service.",

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate's honesty in admitting they don't know is noted. However, for a question addressing a fundamental technical process like containerization and deployment, this answer indicates a complete lack of knowledge or experience in a critical area. In a technical interview, it's generally expected that candidates either provide an answer, discuss related concepts they do know, or explain how they would approach learning/solving such a problem, rather than simply stating 'I don't know.' This response offers no opportunity to assess any foundational understanding or problem-solving skills."
            }
        },
        {
            "question": "Given your experience integrating complex AI models or external AI APIs into backend systems (like your interview system with OpenAI or quiz evaluator with NLP), what are some key considerations you apply to ensure these integrations lead to a stable, performant, and responsive user experience?",
            "answer": "I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate explicitly stated 'I don't know' repeatedly, providing no content or attempt to address the question. While honesty is valued, this response indicates a complete lack of relevant experience or even a foundational understanding of the topic, which is critical for a technical role involving AI integration. In an interview, it's generally better to attempt to relate to a similar concept, explain why the direct experience isn't there but how you'd approach learning, or ask clarifying questions, rather than simply stating a lack of knowledge."
            }
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you had any experience integrating *any* external service into a backend system?",
            "answer": "No, I don't have any experience in the integrating, any back? End systems.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 3.0,
                "feedback": "The candidate's answer is direct and honest, which is commendable for its clarity. However, it's a significant missed opportunity to elaborate or reframe the response. The phrasing 'in the integrating, any back? End systems' is awkward and suggests a lack of familiarity or comfort with the technical terminology and professional communication. A stronger answer would acknowledge the lack of direct experience but then pivot to related skills (e.g., API consumption, understanding of system architecture, data flow) or express eagerness and aptitude for learning, demonstrating problem-solving ability and initiative."
