            "question": "Can you please elaborate on your experience building and managing state in React components, providing specific examples from your projects?",
            "answer": "So, basically, I don't use working on multiple react components. I have a specific knowledge about the Django and the flask, so building a power entry system, I specifically use flask first and the Django applications where the I working on the internal system like your so that's it.",

                "feedback": "The answer is largely irrelevant to the question and demonstrates a lack of understanding of React state management.  The response is unclear, contains grammatical errors, and provides no relevant examples.  Focus on directly answering the question and providing specific examples of your experience with React state management techniques (e.g., useState, useReducer, Context API)."

            "question": "Can you describe a challenging problem you encountered while developing your \"Keeper App\" using React, and explain how you approached solving it, highlighting your understanding of React's component lifecycle or state management?",
            "answer": "So, once 1 of the main challenges, I faced while developing my keeper app in react was managing the State updates when adding uh, deleting not dynamically initially. I stored notes in a simple array and uh, tried maintaining it directly when was added or deleted. However, this react was not consistently really rendering the UI because directly nutrition don't even changes properly.",

                "score": 4.1,
                "feedback": "The answer is difficult to understand due to poor grammar and unclear explanation.  The candidate identifies a relevant challenge (state management), but fails to describe their solution or demonstrate a deep understanding of React's lifecycle or state management. More detail and clearer communication are crucial."

        {
            "question": "Can you describe the specific React state management solution you implemented *after* encountering this initial challenge with directly manipulating the array, and explain how that improved the UI's responsiveness to state changes?",
            "answer": "So, after the realizing that directly mutating the notes area was not triggering the, I shifted to the using react functional State updates with immutable options list of modifying, the existing state. I created a new admin whenever a change occurred. So by doing this, I ensure react always receive new state reference, which allowed reacts by different algorithms to detect changes and the efficiently.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 4.1,
                "feedback": "The answer is difficult to understand due to grammatical errors and unclear phrasing.  It mentions using functional state updates and immutability but lacks specifics on *which* state management solution was implemented (e.g., Context API, Redux, Zustand, etc.).  The explanation of how responsiveness improved is vague and lacks concrete examples. More detail and clearer language are needed."

            "question": "Considering your experience with the \"Keeper App,\" can you explain a specific decision you made regarding state management and its impact on the application's performance or scalability?",
            "answer": "so the response is because uh UI updates were immediate as soon as I added deleted note to directly so",

                "score": 1.9,
                "feedback": "The response is incomprehensible and lacks any specifics.  It doesn't explain a decision, its reasoning, or its impact.

            "question": "Can you please elaborate on how directly updating the UI after adding or deleting a note impacted the app's performance or scalability, and what alternatives you considered?",
            "answer": "So when I first tried update, the UI directly notes array and forcing the renderers the app work for very small cases, but I quickly noticed performance and scalability issue. Numbers are State reference.",

                "score": 3.5,
                "feedback": "The answer is very unclear and lacks detail.  It mentions performance issues but doesn't explain the nature of the issues (e.g., slow rendering, crashes, etc.), nor does it describe the alternatives considered in any detail.  The writing contains grammatical errors and is difficult to understand.  The candidate needs to provide concrete examples and technical explanations to demonstrate their understanding of performance optimization."

            "question": "Considering your experience with the \"Keeper App,\" can you explain a specific challenge you faced related to managing component state and how you overcame it using React Hooks?",
            "answer": "So when specific challenge I faced in keeper as a managing State notes, when adding and deleting the line, initially, I use cleaner and try pushing new notes into it but because react state is incredible. The UI didn't reliable render. After changes, So that's it.",

It mentions a problem with managing state in the Keeper app and implies using React Hooks, but doesn't clearly explain the problem, the solution, or the specific hooks used.  More detail and precise language are needed to effectively communicate the experience."

            "answer": "When the first build the keeper, I managed not in an area and try to add deleted notes by mutating. Add for example, using not push or using notice. So the issue of the react state is immutable by Design. React, doesn't know, look Inside the array to check if it's connected change or that's it.",

It mentions immutability and mutation but doesn't clearly explain *how* the mutation occurred, what the specific symptoms of the unreliable rendering were, or exactly which React Hook was used to solve the problem.  More precise language and a step-by-step explanation are needed."
