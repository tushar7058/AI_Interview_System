                "score": 1.1,
                "feedback": "The response is completely inadequate.  It shows a lack of preparation and professionalism.  The candidate needs to seriously reconsider how they approach interviews and practice answering behavioral and technical questions.  A more honest response acknowledging limited experience with FastAPI and outlining relevant projects or skills would be far more constructive."

            "question": "Can you describe a challenging technical problem you encountered during your internship, regardless of the specific technologies involved?",
            "answer": "So there were no uh, senior uh developers uh, during my internship. So there was no 1 to guide me.",

                "score": 1.8,
                "feedback": "This response is insufficient.  It fails to describe a technical problem and focuses instead on the lack of mentorship.  The candidate needs to articulate a specific challenge, the steps taken to address it, and the outcome.  Significant improvement is needed in clearly communicating technical skills and problem-solving abilities."

            "answer": "So basically it is a totally totally dependent on the project to requirement if the project is lightweight. So uh the first",

                "score": 1.9,
                "feedback": "The response is incomprehensible and lacks any details about the project, its requirements, or a justification for framework selection.  It needs a complete rewrite with a clear explanation of the project, its goals, the frameworks considered (including APS and Django), and a detailed comparison explaining why the chosen framework is the best fit for the specific requirements."

            "answer": "So there was a project it is about just a system management about the employees, so that was not that much uh, a heavy application. So I chose a first API for the back end and there was the application for the banking system. Uh, that was Heavy application and which is for the security purpose. So for that, I use the Django for the back end.",

                "score": 3.8,
                "feedback": "The answer lacks detail and clarity.  The reasoning behind choosing FastAPI for one project and Django for the other is not explained.  More specific examples and justification are needed to demonstrate a strong understanding of each framework's strengths and weaknesses.  Improve verbal fluency and structure for better communication."

            "answer": "So fast API doesn't provide that much Security in by default, but the Django is uh is kind of a heavy framework of the Python. So uh that gives so much security and authentication options. So for the banking, the security is the main concern and authorization is also should be provided while making the project.",

                "score": 3.8,
                "feedback": "The answer lacks detail and precision.  It mentions security as a key differentiator but doesn't elaborate on specific security features of Django or FastAPI.  The comparison is superficial and uses vague language.  Improve clarity by using precise terminology and providing concrete examples.  Expand on the scalability aspects entirely omitted here."

                "feedback": "The honesty is appreciated, but this answer lacks any relevant information.  Consider focusing on transferable skills or acknowledging the gap while outlining a plan to learn the necessary technologies for future roles.  This response suggests a lack of experience in the crucial area specified in the question."
