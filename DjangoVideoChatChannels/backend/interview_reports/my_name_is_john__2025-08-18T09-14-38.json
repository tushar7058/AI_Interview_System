            "question": "You built an AI-powered interview system using FastAPI. Could you elaborate on how you designed its APIs to handle real-time interactions and data processing efficiently?",
            "answer": "Okay, this is okay. This is done by using charity and sometimes Rock.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "This answer is extremely brief and uses terms ('charity,' 'Rock') that are not relevant technical concepts in the context of FastAPI, API design, or AI systems. It demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the question and lacks any technical depth or relevant information about designing APIs for real-time interactions or efficient data processing. A strong answer would have discussed FastAPI's async capabilities, WebSockets, background tasks, streaming, or integration with message queues for handling real-time data and processing efficiently."

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 6,
                "feedback": "The candidate successfully identified and corrected the misheard terms, which is a positive display of active listening and attention to detail. However, the answer stops there. The core of the interviewer's question was to understand the *meaning* of the terms ('charity' and 'Rock' or, as corrected, 'charged GPT' and 'grog') within the context of FastAPI API design. The candidate corrected the words but did not provide the necessary clarification on what 'charged GPT' and 'grog' actually refer to in a technical sense. This leaves the interviewer still in the dark regarding the API design concepts. A stronger answer would have proactively explained the corrected terms to provide the full context requested."

                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The provided answer is incomplete and does not address the question. It appears to be the very beginning of a sentence. To properly evaluate, a specific example of Python backend logic or database query optimization, including the problem, the solution implemented, and the resulting performance improvement, would be needed."

            "question": "Please continue.",
            "answer": "Basically back end optimization is good for the performance. Uh, so basically, if the performance is good, the whole application will be good.",

                "score": 2,
                "feedback": "This answer is very general and lacks depth. While the statement is technically true, it doesn't offer any specific insights, examples, or demonstrate a nuanced understanding of backend optimization beyond a basic high-level concept. The use of filler words like 'Basically' and 'Uh' also detracts from the professional delivery. To improve, aim to provide specific examples, elaborate on the 'how' or 'why,' and demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding of the topic."

            "answer": "So, uh, the reusable code, which can be routing. So I the routing that code can be reused and testable also and uh, if the core optimization is done, then that will be the efficient code and optimal code. And if the the code quality is good, then the code optimization will be done and also the code whole application will be good.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 2,
                "feedback": "Your answer struggled to provide a concrete example from your personal experience, which was the core of the question. You spoke generally about 'routing' and code optimization, but didn't illustrate a specific situation where *you* prioritized reusability, testability, and efficiency. To improve, try to recall a specific project or task. Structure your answer using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to clearly articulate what you did and the impact. Also, focus on *how* you made the code reusable, testable, or efficient, rather than just stating those qualities are good."

            "answer": "no, I don't know about that much but uh, the routing component can be reused because of we can we can we can write the routes and we can reuse them just using copy based on",

                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate explicitly stated a lack of knowledge about the topic, which immediately indicates they cannot answer the core question about their experience. The subsequent attempt to discuss reusability was extremely superficial ('copy based on') and did not demonstrate any technical understanding of how a routing component would be developed with reusability in mind. There was no mention of testability or efficiency, nor any specific examples."

            "answer": "So these both are the postgresql and my screen are the tablet databases. So this is the data is how their different phones, so that will be chosen on the basis of the project requirement.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The answer is incoherent and does not address the question. It lacks any specific example of database schema design or interaction, nor does it mention any considerations made for a backend application. The statements made are confusing and suggest a fundamental misunderstanding of the concepts being asked about. This response does not demonstrate the required technical knowledge or communication clarity."

                "feedback": "The answer is unacceptably brief and completely fails to address the request to 'elaborate.' Using 'Yeah, that's it' is informal for an interview setting and effectively shuts down the conversation, indicating a significant lack of communication skills, engagement, and unwillingness to provide necessary details. It provides no information whatsoever and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the question's intent."
