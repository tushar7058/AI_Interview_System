While the communication is clear, the answer is entirely irrelevant to the question and lacks any depth or detail.  Focus on projects that demonstrate the requested skills for future interviews; if you lack such projects, consider personal projects to build the necessary experience."

The candidate needs to focus on showcasing their skills in managing component state and side effects using any JavaScript framework, even if it's not React.  The answer is unclear, and the communication lacks professionalism."

How did you approach the problem and what steps did you take to resolve the issue?",
            "answer": "While developing the application that is facial recognition, attendance systems, I use the react framework and while connecting it to the back end with our first API uh I have gone through 1 problem. That is uh connectivity and the audio audio and video. And storing the data in the database.",
