            "question": "You've developed several AI-powered applications using Python, FastAPI, and Django. When building the backend for one of these systems, like the AI-powered interview system, how did you approach designing its APIs to ensure they were efficient, maintainable, and scalable for potential real-time usage?",
            "answer": "And I working on a powered application using fast API Django, and python. In that system, I built several applications or we can say a functions for the working AI, interviewer and the candidate for between them.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 2,
                "feedback": "The answer confirms experience with the technologies mentioned (FastAPI, Django, Python) and the type of application (AI-powered interview system). However, it completely misses the core of the question, which was about *how* you approached designing the APIs to ensure efficiency, maintainability, and scalability for real-time usage. The response is very high-level and does not provide any technical details or demonstrate an understanding of API design principles. To improve, you should discuss specific design choices (e.g., RESTful principles, data serialization, authentication, error handling, versioning, strategies for real-time communication like WebSockets or SSE, caching, rate limiting, etc.) and explain how those choices contributed to efficiency, maintainability, and scalability."

            "question": "Could you elaborate on the specific API design choices you made to ensure efficiency, maintainability, and scalability for potential real-time usage?",
            "answer": "You can start.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "This response is completely off-topic and unprofessional. It does not address the technical question in any way and provides no insight into your API design experience or understanding. In an interview setting, this would be highly concerning, indicating either a complete misunderstanding of the question, an inability to answer, or a lack of engagement and professional communication. It's crucial to at least attempt to answer the question, even if you need to clarify or state that you don't have direct experience but can discuss related concepts."

        },
        {
            "question": "You've deployed AI-powered systems using frameworks like FastAPI and Django. How did you ensure these backend applications were robust and performed well once they were running in a production environment?",
            "answer": "So I don't have any any kind of head about the general in the past first.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate's answer is unclear and incoherent, making it impossible to assess their technical knowledge or experience. It appears to indicate a lack of understanding or experience with the core concepts of deploying AI-powered systems with frameworks like FastAPI/Django in production environments. A direct admission of lack of experience would be more professional than an unclear statement."

            "question": "Could you tell me about your experience with ensuring the robustness and performance of *any* backend applications you've deployed to a production environment?",

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate explicitly states a lack of knowledge or experience regarding a critical aspect of the role (ensuring robustness and performance of production backend applications). This answer provides no relevant information and suggests a significant gap in the required skillset. For future interviews, even without direct experience, it would be beneficial to attempt to relate any tangential skills or express a strong willingness to learn and develop in this area, rather than simply stating 'I don't know'."

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 2,
                "feedback": "This answer is unhelpful and creates a conversational dead-end. While direct, it provides no context or clarification as to why the candidate believes they weren't referring to an instance. In a professional setting, especially an interview, it's crucial to either clarify the misunderstanding (e.g., 'Could you help me understand which part of my statement you're referring to?'), or re-explain your previous point if you believe there was a misinterpretation. This response demonstrates a lack of collaborative communication and a missed opportunity to engage further or resolve a potential misunderstanding."

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The answer 'Sure' does not provide any information or insight into your approach to testing backend Python code. To effectively answer this question, you need to describe your methodologies, tools, types of tests (e.g., unit, integration, functional), and how you ensure the code meets the criteria of reliability and maintainability. This response indicates a complete lack of a substantive answer."

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The answer is incomplete and does not elaborate on an approach to testing backend Python code. The phrase 'I check the all system' is vague and doesn't demonstrate specific knowledge of testing methodologies (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, mocking, test frameworks like Pytest). It appears the candidate struggled to formulate a coherent thought or provide a relevant answer."

            "question": "Considering your experience building backend APIs for applications, how would you approach collaborating with frontend developers to ensure seamless integration and data flow?",

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "This answer is completely irrelevant and does not address the question about collaborating with frontend developers for seamless integration. It shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the question or a lack of seriousness. A strong answer would have discussed communication strategies, shared documentation, API design principles, and tools for collaboration."

                "score": 1.0,
                "feedback": "The answer 'Question.' is too brief and lacks professionalism. If unfamiliar with the term 'the coffee table approach,' a stronger response would be to politely ask for clarification or context, demonstrating a willingness to learn and engage, rather than a one-word interjection. This answer provides no insight into your problem-solving or communication skills."
