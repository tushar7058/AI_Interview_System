Use the effect who to send captured image data and retire recognition results. For example, when a user captured, their face, the image was converted to base 64 and sent via post request to the back end. Endpoint the back end responded with the recognition result, which I then stored in a react state that is used state to instantly update the UI and Mark attendance,",

                "feedback": "The answer is relevant to the question but lacks clarity and precision.  The technical description needs significant improvement.  More detail on error handling, state management, and the specifics of the API interaction (including HTTP methods and data structures) is necessary.  Proofread carefully for grammar and spelling."

            "answer": "In my facial recognition attendance system. I placed a strong focus on robust error handling when integrating the facial recognition, rest API into the react front end and the network issues. I wrapped all the API calls in try and catch blocks and maintained it error States using use state to display meaningful feedback such as network error face try again, I also implemented. The try Logic for transient failures, for the system would automatically reattempt a failed requests before notifying the user.",

            "answer": "User capture an image of the recognition API response. Could sometimes be delayed due to network conditions or server load. If I simply update State on every API call, the UI would freeze or show outdated data to solve this. I introduce loading states with use State handle a sink calls inside use effects and use conditionals gendering. So users, or spinner or retra options instead of blank screen.",

Use more precise technical terms and provide concrete examples.  Expand on the implementation details of 'loading states,' 'useState,' 'useEffects,' and 'conditionals.' Explain how these resolved the UI freezing and outdated data issues.  Focus on the React.js specific challenges. Mentioning the API response image capture seems tangential."

            "answer": "In this system, I you just never saw the data or a frozen UI, because loading spinner when the user captured, an image. And the API request was sent. I sent a uh, loading state to True during this state. Instead of showing all results. The UI displayed, a spinner with the message processing image.",

However, during testing, I noticed that when the User submitted a new image quickly, after a previous 1, the UI sometimes display. The old reserve, my expected outcome was the spinner should appear while the API request was in progress, was the back, end responded. The UI should update with the latest recognition result. If an error occurred, the user should see retry option instead of outdated results.",

While the situation and expected outcome are touched upon, the actual outcome and debugging steps lack detail and precision.  Improve clarity by using proper sentence structure and more descriptive language.  Specifically, detail the debugging steps taken (e.g., network analysis, console logs, component lifecycle inspection) and the specific solutions implemented. Quantify the 'quickly' and 'sometimes'.

It doesn't explain the design decision, its impact on maintainability and scalability, or the context of 'old recognition results'.  The description needs significant improvement to be understandable and demonstrate technical proficiency.
