            "question": "Your resume showcases experience building backend applications with FastAPI and Django. When developing these systems, how do you approach ensuring your code is clean, reusable, and easily testable?",
            "answer": "I don't have any kind of idea about this.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "This answer is highly problematic. While honest, stating 'I don't have any kind of idea about this' for a question directly related to experience *showcased on your resume* is a major red flag. It indicates either a significant gap in foundational knowledge for the technologies listed, or a misrepresentation of skills on your resume. In an interview, even if you're unsure, it's crucial to attempt to connect the question to any relevant experience or general programming principles you understand, rather than a complete dismissal. This response suggests a fundamental lack of understanding of software engineering best practices for code quality, which is essential for backend development."

        },
        {
            "question": "Can you describe a specific project you worked on with FastAPI or Django and your role in it?",
            "answer": "No, no means no, yes means yes.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "This response does not answer the question asked. The question was about a specific project using FastAPI or Django and your role in it. Your answer is completely unrelated and provides no information about your technical experience or projects. Please provide a relevant answer to the question."
            }
        },
        {
            "question": "Considering your experience building and deploying backend systems, what steps do you take to ensure the applications you develop perform efficiently and reliably in a production environment?",
            "answer": "No, I don't have an answer.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "This answer indicates a complete inability to address the core of the question, which is critical for a role involving building and deploying backend systems. While direct, it provides no insight into your understanding or approach to performance and reliability, essential aspects of a production environment. In an interview, even if unsure, it's better to attempt to discuss related concepts, ask for clarification, or explain where your experience might be limited and how you'd approach learning. A simple 'No, I don't have an answer' is a significant red flag."
            }
        },
        {
            "question": "Could you elaborate on why you don't have an answer to that question?",
            "answer": "Because I don't have an answer.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "This answer is circular and provides no new information or elaboration. When you don't have an answer, it's crucial to explain *why* you don't have it (e.g., 'That's outside my area of expertise,' 'I'd need to consult my notes for that specific detail,' 'I haven't had direct exposure to that type of scenario'), and ideally, offer a path forward (e.g., 'I could research that for you,' 'Could you provide more context?'). This response signals a lack of communication skills and an unwillingness to engage with the question."

        },
        {
            "question": "Given your experience building APIs with FastAPI and Django, how do you approach designing these APIs to ensure seamless integration and ease of consumption for frontend teams?",
            "answer": "No, I don't have any kind of idea about the what you are asking.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "This answer indicates a complete lack of experience and understanding regarding FastAPI and Django API design, which are central to the question. For roles requiring these specific skills, this response would immediately raise concerns about the candidate's suitability. In future interviews, if you lack direct experience with the specific technologies mentioned, it's more effective to discuss transferable skills, general API design principles you *do* understand, or express your willingness and approach to learning new technologies, rather than stating you have no idea. If the question is unclear, asking for clarification is also an option."
            }

        {
            "question": "Could you clarify what part of the question is unclear?",

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 2,
                "feedback": "The answer is unhelpful and fails to address the question. It reiterates the initial statement without providing any specific clarification, which was the purpose of the follow-up question. This misses an opportunity to demonstrate communication, problem-solving, or proactive engagement by identifying areas of confusion or asking targeted follow-up questions. It comes across as abrupt and disengaged."

        {
            "question": "Walk me through a challenging technical problem you encountered while developing backend logic for a project. How did you diagnose the issue and what steps did you take to resolve it?",
            "answer": "Give me any kind of project to work on that so that's why I don't have any kind of experience.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "This answer completely misses the mark. It directly states a lack of experience, which is problematic when the question is specifically designed to probe your experience with challenges. Instead of attempting to answer by drawing on academic projects, personal projects, or even a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate problem-solving thought processes, you avoided the question entirely and made a request. This shows a lack of preparation, understanding of interview etiquette, and an inability to adapt or reframe a challenging question."

        },
        {
            "question": "Could you describe your approach to diagnosing and resolving a technical problem, even if you haven't faced one in a professional backend setting yet?",

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The answer completely misinterprets the question. The question was asking for a description of your *approach* or *methodology* to diagnose and resolve technical problems, not whether you personally experience issues. This response provides no insight into your problem-solving skills, critical thinking, or how you would tackle a technical challenge. It's essential to listen carefully to the question and provide a relevant, detailed answer that showcases your abilities, even if theoretical or based on non-professional experiences."

        {
            "question": "Given your experience with AI-powered applications and MLOps, how do you approach designing the backend architecture to ensure the system can effectively scale to handle increasing user load and AI model inference demands?",
            "answer": "So, I don't know.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "This answer provides no insight into your experience or approach to backend architecture for scalable AI/MLOps systems. Admitting 'I don't know' directly without any attempt to break down the problem, ask clarifying questions, or discuss related general principles (even if you lack specific experience in this exact area) is a missed opportunity to demonstrate problem-solving skills or a learning mindset. In an interview, it's always better to articulate your thought process, even if unsure, or explain what steps you would take to find the answer."

                "score": 1.0,
                "feedback": "The answer 'British' is completely unrelated to the question about experience with scalable system design or MLOps. It provides no relevant information and does not address the prompt. Please provide a direct answer detailing your experience."
