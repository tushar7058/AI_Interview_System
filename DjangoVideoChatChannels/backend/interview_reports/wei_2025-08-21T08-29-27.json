                "score": 1.8,
                "feedback": "This response is inadequate. It lacks any description of a challenge or problem-solving process.  The claim of having 'lots of knowledge' is unsubstantiated and doesn't address the question.  To improve, describe a specific technical hurdle encountered during development and detail your approach to overcoming it.  Be specific and use examples."

            "question": "While developing any application, even with extensive knowledge, challenges invariably arise. Can you describe a situation where you encountered unexpected behavior or a roadblock, even if you successfully resolved it quickly?",
            "answer": "No, I don't have faced any this kind of situation. So there is no need to resolve this. My system was successfully built.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 2.7,
                "feedback": "The response lacks self-awareness and is not truthful.  The interview question aims to assess problem-solving skills and the ability to learn from challenges; claiming to have never encountered any issues is unrealistic and unprofessional.  The candidate needs to reflect on past projects and honestly describe even minor setbacks and how they were overcome."

                "score": 3.7,
                "feedback": "The answer is perfectly clear in stating a lack of relevant experience.  However, this is insufficient for a technical interview.  Consider focusing on transferable skills or similar projects to demonstrate relevant knowledge, even if the project name is different.  Alternatively, be upfront about the gap and express your eagerness to learn."

                "score": 1.3,
                "feedback": "The response is incomprehensible and does not answer the question.  It mentions 'Keeper application' which seems irrelevant, and lacks any description of a project or data handling.  Please provide a clear, detailed example of a project where you worked with data, outlining your approach to data flow and organization."

Consider focusing on projects you *have* worked on to showcase your skills, even if they aren't directly related to a 'Keeper App.'  Preparing for interviews involves showcasing your experience; fabricating experience is unacceptable."
