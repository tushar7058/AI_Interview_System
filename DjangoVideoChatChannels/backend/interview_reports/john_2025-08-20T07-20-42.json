            "answer": "So, there were no, that much issues in the note keeper app because that project is made with the udv course, which I I bought in the last year and for that, I use the jsx for the, for the styling, I use bootstrap and for to State Management, I use a hook which is a huge state for and with the help of those things. I completed my project of keeper app.",

                "feedback": "The response is difficult to understand and lacks specifics.  It fails to describe a challenging problem or relevant React concepts used to solve it.  Focus on clearly articulating a specific problem, your solution, and the React concepts involved.  Practice concise and professional communication."

            "answer": "It is not huge state. It is huge state. So you what you, you state can do, you state can maintain the state, if, if any Changes made on the front end that will be stored in the state. That is a kind of a variable.",

The candidate needs to demonstrate a deeper understanding of React and their problem-solving abilities with concrete examples.  Consider preparing specific examples of challenges and solutions before the next interview."

Uh, was not intended because I was new, uh, front end developer at that time. So I took some notes from and documentation from the child deputy and I'm",

The candidate needs significant improvement in articulating technical challenges and solutions.  Focus on a *specific* example, explaining the state management problem, the chosen solution (e.g., Context API, Redux, Zustand), and the outcome."

It needs a complete rewrite focusing on a specific example from building the Keeper app, detailing the challenge, the solution implemented, and the outcome.  Consider using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answer."
