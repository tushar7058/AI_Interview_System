            "question": "Describe your experience building React components, specifically addressing how you handled state management and component lifecycle methods in one of your projects.",
            "answer": "Uh, so I don't have that much experience in the react field. I have the knowledge about the python development related field like machine learning and artificial intelligence",

                "score": 1.4,
                "feedback": "The response is completely irrelevant to the question.  It shows a lack of experience in React and poor communication skills in addressing the question directly.  Consider focusing on relevant skills and experiences for the role.  If you lack React experience, be honest, but explain what steps you are taking to gain that experience."
            }

            "question": "Given your stated lack of React experience, could you describe a project where you used a different framework or technology to manage complex application state and handle asynchronous operations?",
            "answer": "So, uh, yes, I have experienced, uh, building with the Django applications related to web development, so, but I don't have that much, uh, experience in the react field.",

                "score": 1.8,
                "feedback": "The answer is extremely unclear, lacks detail about a relevant project, and demonstrates poor communication skills.  The candidate needs to articulate specific project examples showcasing experience with state management and asynchronous operations in a different framework (e.g., Django's ORM, AJAX calls within Django views).  Focus on concrete examples and technical details."

                "score": 1.1,
                "feedback": "The response is completely irrelevant and lacks any technical substance.  The candidate should demonstrate familiarity with React and problem-solving skills.  Consider preparing for technical interviews by practicing common questions and building a portfolio of React projects."

            "question": "Can you describe a challenging problem you encountered while building a component in a different framework or technology, and how you approached solving it?",
            "answer": "So while developing the technology, I tried several uh uh experimental like uh using the Google Docs. Or Etc. But I don't have knowledge.",

                "score": 1.3,
                "feedback": "The response is incomprehensible and lacks any relevant information.  It doesn't describe a problem, the attempted solution, or the outcome.  The candidate needs significant improvement in articulating technical challenges and solutions.  Consider practicing STAR method interview responses."

            "answer": "So, uh, find the building, uh, UI. I tried multiple components of react. Uh, but uh, I don't, uh, have that much knowledge about the building react component. So I have the knowledge about the python development when I will react application. Uh, my Approach To Handle State Management, depends on the complexity of the app and how widely State needs to be shared.",

                "score": 1.9,
                "feedback": "The candidate's response is largely incoherent and demonstrates a significant lack of understanding of React state management.  They need to review fundamental React concepts and practice articulating their technical skills clearly and concisely.  The answer shows almost no relevance to the question."

            "answer": "So as such I don't have that much experience in that, but in the react hooks, there are, there are available local components that for UI related or isolated related things. I use used it. If the state logic is more complex, I switch to the, uh, use register for a clean, run more predictable, State transitions.",

                "score": 2.5,
                "feedback": "The response lacks specifics and demonstrates limited understanding of React state management.  The candidate should provide concrete examples of projects, state management challenges (e.g., performance issues, data synchronization), and the specific solutions attempted (including why they weren't fully successful).  The answer needs significant improvement to showcase relevant experience."
