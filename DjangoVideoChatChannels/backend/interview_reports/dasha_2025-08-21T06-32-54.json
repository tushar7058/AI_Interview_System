                "score": 1.3,
                "feedback": "The response is completely inadequate.  It shows a lack of understanding of the question and a significant inability to articulate technical experience.  The candidate needs to review and practice answering behavioral interview questions, focusing on showcasing relevant skills and experience.  Specific examples are crucial."

Focus on highlighting relevant experience, even if it means addressing the lack of direct experience with React Hooks in the context of the Keeper App specifically, and discussing a similar scenario or a relevant concept you *do* understand."

Like the describing specific challenges while working on reactjs and specification considering or experience building the keeper and discover scenario where you had a management component using that and how you approach the product.",

It lacks specific details about the Keeper App, the state management challenge, and the solution using React Hooks. The candidate needs to significantly improve their ability to articulate technical challenges and solutions clearly and concisely."
