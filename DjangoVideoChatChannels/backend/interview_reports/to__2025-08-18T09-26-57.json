            "question": "Given your experience with FastAPI and Django in building AI-powered applications, how do you approach designing APIs to ensure both responsiveness for users and efficient handling of underlying AI model inferences?",
            "answer": "So, I have, uh, minimal experience in the building first API and Django applications.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate's answer directly indicates a lack of the foundational experience (FastAPI and Django) that the question assumes. While honest, this response means they cannot address any part of the question regarding API design for AI applications, responsiveness, or efficiency. This would be a significant red flag for a role requiring this specific experience."
            }
        },
        {
            "question": "What does 'minimal experience' entail for you regarding FastAPI and Django?",
            "answer": "Uh, means that uh, I have thence while building the j uh, small amount of experieungle and fast API.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 2,
                "feedback": "Your answer was unfortunately unclear and contained a significant error. The use of 'uh' suggests hesitation and a lack of confidence. Crucially, you mispronounced 'Django' as 'jungle,' which raises concerns about your familiarity with the frameworks. To improve, clearly define what 'minimal experience' means to you with specific examples (e.g., 'I've completed a basic CRUD application' or 'I'm familiar with core concepts like ORM and routing'), and practice articulating your thoughts clearly and confidently."

            "question": "Given your experience with Docker and deploying projects on GCP, how do you approach ensuring a Python backend application is not just functional but also scalable and robust for production environments?",
            "answer": "So I have the knowledge about Docker but I don't use uh any uh any uh gcp platforms or the AWS platform for the deploying my applications. But uh with the help of Docker, I created some images uh to the ensuring that uh that is very scalable and and and projects",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 3,
                "feedback": "While it's good that you were honest about your lack of experience with GCP/AWS for deployment, this question specifically asks about that experience. Your answer also lacked depth on *how* Docker images ensure scalability and robustness, going beyond just creating them. For future answers, try to elaborate on the 'how' and address all parts of the question, even if you need to explain what you'd do to learn or bridge a knowledge gap."
            }

        {
            "question": "Beyond packaging, how do your Docker image configurations specifically contribute to a Python application's scalability and robustness?",

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 2,
                "feedback": "The answer directly states a lack of knowledge on the topic. While honesty is appreciated, it provides no insight into your technical capabilities, problem-solving approach, or willingness to learn. In future interviews, if you don't know the exact answer, try to pivot to related concepts you are familiar with, explain your learning process for such topics, or express your interest in researching and understanding them."

                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The answer 'Okay.' is far too brief and does not address the question asked. It provides no information about a challenging bug, the diagnostic process, or its resolution, which are all critical components of the prompt. This response indicates a lack of detail, an inability to articulate technical experiences, or a misunderstanding of the question's intent. For a role where debugging and optimization are key, a detailed, structured example is expected."

                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "This response indicates a complete lack of relevant experience or an unwillingness to engage with the question. For a Python backend role, the ability to debug and resolve challenging issues is a core competency. An answer of 'Don't know' is highly concerning and provides no insight into the candidate's skills or problem-solving approach. Even if a 'challenging' bug hasn't been encountered, a candidate should be able to describe *any* bug they've debugged, or at least their general approach to debugging."

It doesn't address any potential underlying question and offers nothing to evaluate. In an interview setting, it's crucial to provide detailed and comprehensive answers that demonstrate your understanding, experience, or perspective."

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate's response is incomplete and does not address the question at all. It appears to be a partial thought or an interruption rather than an answer. No information is provided about their experience with database schema design for AI applications."

                "score": 1.0,
                "feedback": "This answer is completely off-topic and does not address the question about your approach to designing database schemas. It sounds like a generic, non-responsive statement that doesn't make sense in context. You need to listen carefully to the question and provide a direct, relevant, and specific answer detailing your methodology, steps, tools, or considerations in schema design."
