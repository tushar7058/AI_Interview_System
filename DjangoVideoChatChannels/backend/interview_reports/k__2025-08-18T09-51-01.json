            "answer": "candidate as well.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate's response, 'candidate as well,' did not address the question posed. It provided no information regarding the design of backend API endpoints, handling real-time interactions, or integrating external services like OpenAI APIs. As such, it's impossible to evaluate clarity, relevance, depth, or confidence concerning the technical subject matter. This response appears to be a non-answer or an incomplete statement."

        {
            "question": "Could you elaborate on the specific API endpoint design choices you made to support real-time interactions and integrate services like OpenAI, as your previous response was unclear regarding these technical details?",
            "answer": "API is very important for our system.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate's response, 'API is very important for our system,' completely misses the mark. It provides zero depth or relevance to the specific technical details requested regarding API endpoint design choices for real-time interactions and OpenAI integration. The question explicitly asked for elaboration due to previous unclarity, yet this answer offers a generic, uninformative statement that demonstrates a significant lack of understanding or inability to articulate the required technical specifics. It shows neither clarity on the technical topic nor confidence in providing a detailed answer."

            "question": "Beyond just functionality, our team values writing reusable and testable backend code. How do you approach designing your Python solutions to ensure they meet these qualities?",

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate's response is clear in its admission of not knowing the answer, but it completely lacks relevance, depth, and confidence. Repeating 'I don't know' three times for a core technical design question indicates a complete absence of knowledge or experience in a critical area for a backend role. This answer provides no insight into their technical understanding or approach and significantly impacts their perceived capability and suitability for the position."

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate's answer completely failed to address the question. The question asked for an approach to API design, focusing on consumability and documentation for frontend developers, highlighting collaboration. The candidate responded with a generic, incomplete, and hesitant statement about Python coding experience. This shows a complete lack of relevance, depth, and clarity regarding the specific technical challenge presented. The confidence was also notably low due to the fumbling delivery."

                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate's answer demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the question. It is entirely irrelevant, lacks any clarity or depth related to API design or documentation, and suggests a significant communication breakdown. The phrase 'fight about this' is also inappropriate for a professional interview setting. This response provides no usable information about the candidate's technical skills or problem-solving approach."

            "question": "Your Hotel Reservation System project involved deploying scalable models on GCP with an MLOps workflow. When building a Python backend application, how do you consider deployment and scalability aspects from the initial design phase?",
            "answer": "Based on that score.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate's answer 'Based on that score' is completely irrelevant to the technical question asked. It provides no insight into their understanding of deployment and scalability aspects in backend development, nor does it demonstrate any technical knowledge or problem-solving approach. It appears to be a meta-comment or a misunderstanding of the interview context rather than an answer to the prompt. Therefore, it lacks clarity in addressing the question, relevance to the topic, depth of knowledge, and confidence in technical explanation."

            "question": "Could you please elaborate on how you factor in deployment and scalability during the initial design phase for a Python backend, specifically considering a GCP environment and an MLOps workflow?",

            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate's answer of 'I don't know' is crystal clear and directly addresses the question, demonstrating honesty and confidence in their admission. However, it provides absolutely no technical depth or relevance to the specific scenario (GCP, MLOps, initial design, deployment, scalability for Python backends). For a question of this specificity and importance, a complete lack of knowledge indicates a critical skills gap for a role that would likely require such expertise. While honesty is a valuable trait, it does not compensate for the absence of required technical understanding. This response suggests the candidate is not suitable for a position where this knowledge is a core competency."

                "score": 1,
                "feedback": "The candidate's response 'No, no' is entirely uninformative and fails to address the question in any capacity. It demonstrates a complete lack of clarity, relevance, and depth regarding the technical topic. This non-answer indicates either a significant absence of knowledge on the subject or an inability to articulate any response, which is a critical concern for a role requiring technical proficiency and professional communication."

            "answer": "No, I don't have any experience in this area.",
            "evaluation": {
                "score": 1.0,
                "feedback": "The answer is extremely clear and direct in stating a lack of experience. However, it fails significantly on depth and relevance. A strong candidate would use this as an opportunity to demonstrate related skills (e.g., general database design, SQL knowledge, experience in other backend languages), express enthusiasm for learning, or ask clarifying questions to understand the scope of the required knowledge. This response completely shuts down the conversation, demonstrating a lack of initiative and a missed opportunity to showcase transferable skills or a growth mindset."
