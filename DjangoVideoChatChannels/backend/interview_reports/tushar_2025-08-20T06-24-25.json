It's like the project developing the Titan application. So my complex project is that so uh building a build a air power into your system. So that 1 was very the project. I have been working on so far, that's it.",

            "answer": "So basically I work on projects, like with the help of jungle and the first API, but specifically, I use the flask framework because the flask framework is very lightweight for the building, uh, apis for the web application. So that's why I don't have any kind of how I have this. So that's it from my side.",

It lacks specific details about a design challenge, the trade-offs considered, and uses unclear language ('jungle and the first API').
